# Pro-Path

**Pro-Path** is a revolutionary web platform designed to guide university students in defining their academic and professional trajectories. By leveraging data from previous cohorts, Pro-Path provides personalized recommendations based on student performance, interests, and aspirations, while also adapting to market needs. Additionally, the platform connects students with mentors for personalized guidance.

---

## Key Features

1. **Personalized Path Recommendations**:
   - Students input their grades, interests, and internship preferences.
   - The platform uses a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to recommend academic paths tailored to individual profiles.

2. **Mentorship Connection**:
   - Students can browse mentors' profiles, view their expertise, and request mentorship sessions directly through the platform.

3. **Scalable Design**:
   - Initially implemented for *Ecole Centrale Casablanca*, Pro-Path can be adapted to any institution with appropriate data.

4. **Administrative Support**:
   - Administrators can upload curriculum PDFs for students to download and explore.

5. **Secure Login System**:
   - Passwords are hashed using `bcrypt` for secure authentication.

6. **Email Notifications**:
   - Mentors can accept or deny mentorship requests, with email notifications sent to students.
